Online CV for myself as I got tired to re-build PDFs all the time.

* Printable version of the CV can be found at `https://andreygrin.github.io/ahrynch-cv/print`. Use a third party link https://pdflayer.com/, https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/ etc to get the printable PDF.

### To preview/edit locally with docker
Change all the details from one place: `_data/data.yml`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

*docker-compose.yml* file is used to create a container that is reachable under <http://localhost:4000>.
Changes *_data/data.yml* will be visible after a while.
