          - Data collection and analysis
          - Writing SQL queries to create key metrics
          - Creating a dashboard with visualizations in Metabase
          - Writing a report on data visualizations and conclusions for the company's operations
          - Presenting the dashboard
          
          As a data analyst, I exported and analyzed data from the production PostgreSQL database to evaluate KPIs for customs brokers. I also set up Metabase from the ground up and created a dashboard split into four pages.
          
          - The first page was dedicated to shipments and parcels, featuring metrics such as the total number of parcels, processed shipment weight, and a graph showing the average shipment weight correlated with the number of parcels.
          - The second page included metrics related to customs declaration processing times, such as the average time it takes for customs brokers from the moment a shipment arrives until the first declaration is submitted, as well as the average time for customs declarations to be cleared in different countries.
          - The third page contained a table listing active users for each company and the amount of work they completed.
          - The fourth page presented a mock-up of a future dashboard to be built by developers in the x7trade app.
  
          Each page included a set of filters allowing users to filter data by date, company, and customs country. The visual graphs and metrics helped identify which companies processed the most shipments, which customs were the fastest, and the average time spent processing shipments in the warehouse. The dashboard was built based on live queries from the production database.
          I also provided documentation for the developers and suggestions for database optimization to the development team.
